# TdDS
We designed a top-down deep supervised (TdDS) method. tdDS can guide the model to learn the segmentation process from coarse to fine, which is very similar to the thinking process of a doctor delineating a lesion. tdDS facilitates the performance of the model in delineating fuzzy boundaries.

We have implemented it on the U-Net framework. Good results were obtained on colorectal cancer data.
